# Statistical Machine Learning (SML)
Material on the Statistical Machine Learning (SML) course

Statistical Machine Learning refers to a set of tools for inferring, predicting and extracting common features and hidden structures in massive and complex datasets available in diverse scientific disciplines, such as marketing, e-commerce, economics, finance, social media, genomics, neuroscience, bioinformatics, meteorology, transport and telecommunications, just to name a few, where the explosion of “Big Data” problems has become the rule rather than exception. The field encompasses many theories, methods and algorithms, for instance, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and outlier detection techniques in high-dimensional data settings, estimation and testing under sparsity, tree-based methods, bagging, boosting, random forests, neuralnetworks, support vector machines, and graphical methods, all these developed for classification and regression problems. Thus, numerous public and private organizations are needing professionals with statistical learning and computer programming skills to analyze their datasets. The goal of this intermediate course is to provide a self-contained overview of key concepts underlying many of statistical learning and data mining tools. For each method, a description of intuitive ideas, necessary mathematical and statistical details, and algorithmic implementation is provided.
